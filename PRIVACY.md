# Privacy Policy — DevJSON

**Effective date:** February 11, 2026

## Summary

DevJSON does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. Period.

## What DevJSON Does

DevJSON is a Chrome DevTools panel that inspects JSON API responses from the page you are debugging. It runs entirely within Chrome DevTools and operates only when DevTools is open.

## Data Collection

DevJSON collects **no data** of any kind:

- **No personal information** is collected
- **No browsing history** is tracked
- **No analytics or telemetry** is sent
- **No network requests** are made by the extension itself
- **No data leaves your browser** — everything stays in the DevTools panel

## Permissions

DevJSON requests **zero permissions**. It uses only the `chrome.devtools.network` API, which is available to all DevTools extensions without additional permissions.

## Local Storage

DevJSON stores your selected theme preference in `localStorage` within the DevTools panel context. This data never leaves your browser and is automatically cleared when you uninstall the extension.

## Third Parties

DevJSON has no third-party dependencies at runtime, no analytics SDKs, no ad networks, and no external services.

## Open Source

DevJSON is open source. You can audit the complete source code at:
https://github.com/dyemane/devjson

## Changes

If this policy changes, the update will be posted here and the version number in the extension will be incremented.
